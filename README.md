# rock-paper-scissors-exercise
Rock paper scissors python game for OPIM 243

# User instructions

First, in the command line, navigate to the location in which the repo is stored. If it's on the desktop, your command should be something like `cd ~/Desktop/rock-paper-scissors-exercise`.

If this is the first time setting up and you have Anaconda set up, you can use the command line and type `conda create -n my-game-env python=3.8` to create the environment.
Next, activate it by using the command `conda activate my-game-env`.

Once you're in that folder, try executing `python game.py`. If this works, the game should begin and you should see a welcome message and a prompt to choose your action.

# Customizing Player Name
By default, the player's name is "Player One" - this can be changed locally using the .env file.

The requirements.txt file contains the `python-dotenv` requirement. To customize the player name using the .env file, first install package dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

In a .env file, set `USER_NAME` equal to your desired name. For example, if I were to use my name, it would be `USER_NAME = "Bryan Zhou"`

Then, upon runing the app, you should see "Welcome 'Bryan Zhou' ..." instead of 'Player One'

Alternatively, you can also customize your name directly from the command line using `USER_NAME="Bryan Zhou" python game.py`, which will start the game as well.

# Explanation of Project Requirements
The `input()` function is used to accept a command from the user, either "rock," "paper," or scissors." This string is converted into lower case, and if none of these are entered, it will stop the program using `exit()`.

The `random.choice()` function is used to simulate a computer choice.

A series of `if` statements are then used to determine who the winner is, or if it's a tie.

Additionally, a `while` loop is used to allow the user to play more than once. This was not required, just put in for fun to practice.
