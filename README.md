Rock paper scissors project

#Setup instructions

After cloning the repo into Github desktop, use `cd ~/Desktop/rock-paper-scissors-exercise` in the command line to navigate into the folder

Create a file using VS Code titled game.py and type in `print("Rock, Paper, Scissors, Shoot!")`

If this is the first time setting up, use the command line and type `conda create -n my-game-env python=3.8` to create the environment
Next, activate it by using the command `conda activate my-game-env`

Once you're in that virtual environment, try executing `python game.py`. If this works, you should be seeing the text string that you entered earlier!

Now you're all done with environment setup, move into the requirements next
